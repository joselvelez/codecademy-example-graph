Example Graph Data Structure in Python

Vertex:
* Uses a dictionary as an adjacency list to store connected vertices.
* Connected vertex names are keys and the edge weights are values.
* Has methods to add edges and return a list of connected vertices.

Graph:
* Can be initialized as a directed graph, where edges are set in one direction.
* Stores every vertex inside a dictionary
  * Vertex data is the key and the vertex instance is the value.
* Has methods to add vertices, edges between vertices, and determine if a path exists between two vertices.
